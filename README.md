# AOC Functional

Repository for the challange of clearing Advent of Code in TS/JS with a functional approach - each solution no longer than a single line. Exact rules below:

-   for each day there should be two one-liner statements, solving the first and second part
-   the result should be printed into the console
-   reading/importing the import can (should) be done in a seperate file, check the current solutions for more info
-   each one-liner should be present in:
    -   true form of a single line
    -   a formatted, readable, understandable version (some content, except whitespace)
-   no `;` allowed to cheat more than a single statement into one line!
-   predefined helper functions (provided here) are allowed:
    -   `.use((item) => result)` can be used to act as a variable and allow reusability of values
    -   `...`

## Solutions

Some solutions for specific years are available under `/solutions`
